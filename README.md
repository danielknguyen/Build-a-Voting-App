# Build-a-Voting-App
Project that allows users to create, read, share and delete voting polls.

<p>Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:</p>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.</li>
  <li>As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.</li>
  <li>As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.</li>
  <li>As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.</li>
  <li>As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.</li>
  <li>As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.</li>
  <li> As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)</li>
  <li>As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.</li>
</ol>
